New projections from the American Heart Association warn that over the next 25 years, cardiovascular disease will rise sharply, driven largely by a surge in high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity. By 2050, nearly 60% of women in the U.S. could have high blood pressure, and close to one in three women ages 22 to 44 may already be living with some form of heart disease.",
