These microbes use specialized sensors to move toward valuable nutrients, with lactate and formate standing out as especially important fuel sources.",

Scientists estimate that more than 7,000 adult penguins were killed in just four years, many of them left uneaten. While the losses are dramatic, models show that pumas alone are unlikely to wipe out the colony. Greater dangers come from poor breeding and low survival among young penguins.",
