The model reproduced key damage seen in real spinal cord injuries, including inflammation and scar formation. After treatment with fast moving \u201cdancing molecules,\u201d nerve fibers began growing again and scar tissue shrank. The results suggest the therapy could eventually help repair spinal cord damage.",
