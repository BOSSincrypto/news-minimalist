Scientists have now developed a new forecasting method that can predict how much Arctic sea ice will remain months in advance, focusing on September when ice levels are at their lowest. By combining long-term climate patterns, seasonal cycles, and short-term weather shifts, the model delivers real-time predictions that outperform existing approaches",

New research finally explains why. Scientists discovered that these T cells aren\u2019t all the same: one subtype actually helps keep tumors in check, while another shields cancer from immune attack. The balance between these \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d cells can determine whether a tumor grows or shrinks.",
