New research suggests the earliest sponges were soft and skeleton-free, explaining why their fossils don\u2019t appear until much later. By analyzing hundreds of genes and modeling how skeletons evolved, scientists found that mineralized spicules arose separately in different sponge lineages. The discovery rewrites the story of how the first reef-building animals\u2014and possibly the first animals of all\u2014emerged.",
