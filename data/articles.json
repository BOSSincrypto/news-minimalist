      "original_description": "A new OLED design can stretch dramatically while staying bright, solving a problem that has long limited flexible displays. The breakthrough comes from pairing a highly efficient light-emitting material with tough, transparent MXene-based electrodes. Tests showed the display kept most of its brightness even after repeated stretching. The technology could power future wearable screens and on-skin health sensors.",
