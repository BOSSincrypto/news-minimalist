Researchers found that oil-based ointments can be absorbed into the implant\u2019s material, causing it to swell and sometimes break. Patient cases showed damage only when the implant directly contacted the ointment, a result confirmed in lab experiments. The findings raise concerns about standard post-surgery eye care.",
