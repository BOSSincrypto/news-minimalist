Scientists have now identified the precise molecular trigger behind these side effects. They found that statins jam open a critical muscle protein, causing a toxic calcium leak. The discovery could lead to safer statins that keep their life-saving benefits without the muscle damage.",

With no specific anti-sepsis therapy currently available, the findings mark a major step forward. Researchers now aim to move into Phase III trials.",
