Researchers found that oil-based ointments can be absorbed into the implant\u2019s material, causing it to swell and sometimes break. Patient cases showed damage only when the implant directly contacted the ointment, a result confirmed in lab experiments. The findings raise concerns about standard post-surgery eye care.",

      "original_description": "A new OLED design can stretch dramatically while staying bright, solving a problem that has long limited flexible displays. The breakthrough comes from pairing a highly efficient light-emitting material with tough, transparent MXene-based electrodes. Tests showed the display kept most of its brightness even after repeated stretching. The technology could power future wearable screens and on-skin health sensors.",
