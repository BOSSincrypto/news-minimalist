      "original_description": "A remarkable Roman mosaic found in Rutland turns out to tell a forgotten version of the Trojan War. Rather than Homer\u2019s famous epic, it reflects a lost Greek tragedy by Aeschylus, featuring vivid scenes of Achilles and Hector. Its artistic patterns echo designs from across the ancient Mediterranean, some dating back 800 years before the mosaic was made. The discovery suggests Roman Britain was deeply plugged into the wider classical world.",
