      "original_description": "Scientists have proposed a surprising connection between solar flares and earthquakes. When solar activity disturbs the ionosphere, it may generate electric fields that penetrate fragile fracture zones in Earth\u2019s crust. If a fault is already critically stressed, this extra electrostatic pressure could help trigger a quake. The idea doesn\u2019t claim direct causation, but it offers a fresh way to think about how space weather and seismic events might interact.",

      "original_description": "A UCLA study in mice reveals that aging muscle stem cells accumulate a protein that slows repair but boosts survival. This protein, NDRG1, acts like a brake, preventing cells from activating quickly after injury. When researchers blocked it in older mice, muscle healing sped up dramatically \u2014 but stem cells became less resilient over time. The work suggests aging may reflect a survival trade-off rather than straightforward decline.",
