      "original_description": "For years, compulsive behaviors have been viewed as bad habits stuck on autopilot. But new research in rats found the opposite: inflammation in a key decision-making brain region actually made behavior more deliberate, not more automatic. The change was linked to astrocytes, brain support cells that multiplied and disrupted nearby circuits. The discovery hints that some compulsive behaviors may arise from excessive, misdirected control rather than a loss of it.",

      "original_description": "Scientists at Michigan State University have uncovered the molecular \u201cswitch\u201d that powers sperm for their final, high-speed dash toward an egg. By tracking how sperm use glucose as fuel, the team discovered how dormant cells suddenly flip into overdrive, burning energy in a carefully controlled, multi-step process. A key enzyme, aldolase, helps convert sugar into the burst of power needed for fertilization, while other enzymes act like traffic controllers directing the flow of fuel.",
